LLM Fractals
============

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project evaluates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in generating and evaluating fractal visualizations.
It includes several fractal examples implemented as HTML files, such as:
  - Julia Set
  - Koch Snowflake
  - Mandelbrot Set
  - 3D Mandelbrot

Project Description:
--------------------
The purpose of this project is to explore how effectively LLMs can generate code for creating complex fractal patterns.
Each fractal visualization demonstrates different mathematical properties and recursive patterns.
The project serves both as a technical evaluation of LLM capabilities and as a creative exploration of fractal geometry.

File Structure:
---------------
  - index.html         : A landing page with links to each fractal visualization.
  - julia.html         : Visualizes the Julia Set fractal.
  - koch.html          : Visualizes the Koch Snowflake fractal.
  - mandelbrot.html    : Visualizes the Mandelbrot Set fractal.
  - mandelbrot-3d.html : Visualizes a 3D version of the Mandelbrot Set fractal.
  - README.txt         : This file.

Usage:
------
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click on the links to view individual fractal visualizations.
